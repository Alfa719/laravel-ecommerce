            Beryl Cook is one of Britain’s most talented and amusing artists
            .Beryl’s pictures feature women of all shapes and sizes enjoying
            themselves .Born between the two world wars, Beryl Cook eventually
            left Kendrick School in Reading at the age of 15, where she went
            to secretarial school and then into an insurance office. After
            moving to London and then Hampton, she eventually married her next
            door neighbour from Reading, John Cook. He was an officer in the
            Merchant Navy and after he left the sea in 1956, they bought a pub
            for a year before John took a job in Southern Rhodesia with a
            motor company. Beryl bought their young son a box of watercolours,
            and when showing him how to use it, she decided that she herself
            quite enjoyed painting. John subsequently bought her a child’s
            painting set for her birthday and it was with this that she
            produced her first significant work, a half-length portrait of a
            dark-skinned lady with a vacant expression and large drooping
            breasts. It was aptly named ‘Hangover’ by Beryl’s husband and

            It is often frustrating to attempt to plan meals that are designed
            for one. Despite this fact, we are seeing more and more recipe
            books and Internet websites that are dedicated to the act of
            cooking for one. Divorce and the death of spouses or grown
            children leaving for college are all reasons that someone
            accustomed to cooking for more than one would suddenly need to
            learn how to adjust all the cooking practices utilized before into
            a streamlined plan of cooking that is more efficient for one
            person creating less
